Suppose you have a set of documents (PDFs, Notion pages, customer questions, etc.) and you want to summarize the content.
LLMs are a great tool for this given their proficiency in understanding and synthesizing text.
In this walkthrough we'll go over how to perform document summarization using LLMs.

A central question for building a summarizer is how to pass your documents into the LLM's context window. Two common approaches for this are:
1.Stuff: Simply "stuff" all your documents into a single prompt. This is the simplest approach (see here for more on the StuffDocumentsChains, which is used for this method).
2.Map-reduce: Summarize each document on it's own in a "map" step and then "reduce" the summaries into a final summary (see here for more on the MapReduceDocumentsChain, which is used for this method).
