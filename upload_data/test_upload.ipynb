       "[Document(page_content='According to the original definition of mechatronics proposed by the Yasakawa Electric Company and the definitions that have appeared since, many of the engineering products designed and manufactured in the last 25 years integrating mechanical and electrical systems can be classified as mechatronic systems. Yet many of the engineers and researchers responsible for those products were never formally trained in mechatronics per se. The Mechatronics Handbook can serve as a reference resource for those very same design engineers to help connect their everyday experience in design with the vibrant field of mechatronics. More generally, this handbook is intended for use in research and development departments in academia, government, and industry, and as a reference source in university libraries. It can also be used as a resource for scholars interested in understanding and explaining the engineering design process. As the historical divisions between the various branches of engineering and computer science become less clearly defined, we may well find that the mechatronics specialty provides a roadmap for nontraditional engineering students studying within the traditional structure of most engineering colleges. It is evident that there is an expansion of mechatronics laboratories and classes in the university environment worldwide. This fact is reflected in the list of contributors to this handbook, including an international group of 88 academicians and engineers representing 13 countries. It is hoped that the Mechatronics Handbook can serve the world community as the definitive reference source in mechatronics. \\n\\n\\n\\nOrganization \\n\\nThe Mechatronics Handbook is a collection of 50 chapters covering the key elements of mechatronics: a.

Tech., Vol. 15 ,  No. 1, January -March 2010  \\n 70 Pattern -based Extraction of Named \\nEntities in Thai News Documents  \\n \\nNattapong Tongtep1 and Thanaruk Theeramunkong2 \\n \\nSirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat University  \\n{nattapong1, thanaruk2}@siit.tu.ac.th  \\n \\nAbstract  \\n \\nNamed entity extracti on is a n ontrivial and challenging task for  information extraction \\nin Thai language since a Thai text has no word, phrase and sentence boundary. This paper \\nproposes a pattern -based method to extract Thai named entities, such as person name, \\norganization na me, location, date and time, as well as action phrases  from a text, without \\nassistance of word segmentation and part -of-speech tagging. The experimental results show \\nthat the proposed method can detect named entities with approximately 68-100%  correctness , \\nusing a large -scale Thai dictionary and a set of predefined pattern matching templates.  \\n \\nKeywords : Named Entity, Information Extraction, Pattern Classification  \\n \\n1. Introduction  \\n \\nInformation extraction (IE) is a \\nbasic task to obtain valuable information \\nfrom an unstructured text. As a main \\nprocess in IE, named entity (NE) extraction/  \\nclassification detects a chunk of words \\nwhich specifies a unique existence, such as \\na person, a time period and a location, and \\nthen assigns a type to such detected NE. \\nEach N E usually specifies a main point in \\nthe text, which often relates to 4W (who, \\nwhat, when and where) questions. Problems \\nrelated to NE include NE boundary \\ndisambiguation, clueless NE detection, \\nmisspelled NE detection, and NE tagging \\n(classification). So fa r, a large number of \\nresearch works have been done to detect \\nNEs in various languages. Part of the early \\nNE research on English texts, a method to \\nextract and recognize company names, was \\nproposed by Rau in 1991 [1]. The method \\nrelied on heuristics with ma nually \\nconstructed rules.  Later, from 1991 to present, a series \\nof Message Understanding Conferences \\n(MUC) have attracted a lot of researchers to \\ninvent plentiful novel methods in extracting \\ninformation, especially NEs, from a free \\ntext [2; 3; 4; 5]. NEs c an be extracted from \\nnot only general documents but also web \\ndocuments via search queries [6]. Besides \\nEnglish, there have been a number of works \\nrelated to NE extraction in several \\nlanguages, including Japanese [7; 8; 9; 10], \\nChinese [11; 12; 13; 14], Vie tnamese [15], \\nHindi [16] and Korean [17].  \\nNE is likely to appear synchro -\\nnously in several news articles, whereas a \\ncommon noun is less likely. It was reported \\nthat [22; 23] NEs can be recognized with \\n90% accuracy just by comparing time series \\ndistribution s of a word in two newspapers, \\nbut the recall was not sufficient yet. One of \\nthe difficulties in extracting NEs in Thai \\nlanguage is that a Thai text has no explicit \\nboundary for words, phrases or even \\nsentences [18; 19; 20; 21]. Spaces are \\noccasionally ins erted between words or', metadata={'source': 'upload_data_type/pdf/boonsiri,+Journal+manager,+20101501p8.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Thammasat Int. J. Sc. Tech., Vol. 15 ,  No. 1, January -March 2010  \\n 71 phrases within sentences, but there is no \\nstandard rule for using spaces. In Thai, a \\nparagraph often contains chunks of phrases \\nthat do not together constitute sentences \\ngrammatically. Sometimes, the main sub -\\nject, verb, or object ca n be omitted from a \\nsentence or their positions, and it is still \\nconsidered valid. The high language -\\nstructure ambiguity seriously hinders any \\nautomated process on Thai language. For \\nThai NE extraction, a number of works [22; \\n23] used clue words, spaces an d discourse \\ncontext to discover proper names in Thai, \\nand then to assign a part -of-speech (POS) \\ntag to each detected proper name. Some \\nrecent works [24; 25; 26] have studied \\ncompound nouns in news documents where \\ncompound nouns tend to be NEs (proper \\nnames ). In [27], performance of Thai NE \\nextraction using maximum entropy models \\nwith simple heuristic information to extract \\nnames of person, organization, and location \\nwas reported to be in the range of 75 -90% \\nF-measure.  \\nIn this paper, we propose a pattern -\\nbased approach for NE extraction, \\nespecially a person, a time period, a location \\nand an event from Thai news documents. \\nTechniques of longest word matching, \\nlongest pattern matching and pattern \\ncategorization are applied to construct a set \\nof patterns in the form of regular \\nexpressions for retrieving our focused NEs. \\nMoreover, we have introduced a concept of \\nThai Character Clusters (TCCs) [28] and \\nstop words/phrases into pattern construc -\\ntion. By experiments, we also investigate a \\nsuitable sequence of applying  regular \\nexpressions. A number of experiments are \\ndone on various types of news. The \\norganization of the paper is as follows. \\nSections 2 -3 describe the types of NEs \\nincluding action phrases. Our pattern -based \\nextraction is presented in Section 4. In \\nSectio n 5, the experimental result and error \\nanalysis are discussed. A conclusion is \\ngiven in Section 6.  \\n 2. Types of Named Entities  \\n \\nThis section describes the types of \\nNEs we set as targets of extraction from \\nThai news documents. They are date, time, \\nperson na me and location. In our approach, \\neach type of NEs can be viewed as a chunk \\nof information.  \\n2.1 Temporal Expression  \\nLike most languages, Thai date and \\ntime expressions are a combination of \\ncharacters, symbols and numbers. Thai \\nnumbers are of two types of c haracters; \\nRoman and Thai. Yingseree et al. [29] \\nclassified time expressions into two types: \\nabsolute and relative time expressions. The \\nabsolute time expressions specifies a time \\npoint or time period that is unique in any \\nsituation while the relative time  expression \\nrepresents a time point/period that depends \\non the situation, such as geographical \\nlocation and the previous time point. \\nAbsolute time expressions include the \\nexpressions of day of the month, day in \\nweek, month, year, era, time unit, and \\nzodiac . The relative time expressions \\ninvolve the expression of season and a \\npreposition, such as “before”, “after”, and \\n“two days before”. Some detailed date/time \\nsubtypes are:  \\nDay of the month : A day of the \\nmonth represented by an Arabic number (1 -\\n31), a Thai number ( ๑- ๓๑) or a day of the \\nmonth in words ( หนึ่ง – สา มสิบเอ็ด ). \\nDay in Week : A day -in-week is \\nrepresented by its full name ( จ ันทร์ – อ า ทิตย ์ ) \\n(Monday - Sunday) or its abbreviation ( จ. - \\nอา.) (Mon. - Sun.).  \\nMonth : A month is represented by \\nits full name ( มก รา คม  – ธันว า คม ) (January - \\nDecember), its abbreviation ( ม. ค. - ธ. ค.) \\n(Jan. - Dec.), an Arabic number (1 -12) or a \\nThai number ( ๑- ๑๒). \\nYear : A year is represented by an \\nArabic numbers, a Thai number or a year in \\nwords ( สอ ง พ ันแ ปด ) (two thousand eight).', metadata={'source': 'upload_data_type/pdf/boonsiri,+Journal+manager,+20101501p8.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Tech., Vol. 15 ,  No. 1, January -March 2010  \\n 72 Year in Chi nese Zodiac : A 12 -year \\ncycle in Chinese Zodiac is represented by \\nnames of auspicious animals.  \\nEra: Buddhist era ( พ ุทธศัก รา ช ), \\nChristian era ( คริสต์ศัก รา ช ) and so on.  \\nTime Unit : A unit is used for \\nrepresenting time such as seconds ( ว ินา ที). \\nSeason : A name i s represented a \\nseason such as summer ( ฤ ดูร้อ น ). \\nWestern Zodiac : An annual cycle \\nof twelve stations along the ecliptic such as \\nCapricorn ( รา ศีมัง ก ร ) and Aquarius ( รา ศีก ุมภ ์ ). \\nThe full list of the names is shown \\nin the Appendix.  \\n2.2 Location Expression  \\nLoca tion expressions in NE \\nextraction from news documents are varied \\nin the dimensions of relativeness vs. abso -\\nluteness, and political vs. organizational vs. \\nnatural. In this work, we classify a location \\nexpression into four types as follows.  \\nOrganizational : A location where \\npeople work together under certain \\nregulations such as institute, company, \\nschool, university, office, society, and club.  \\nPolitical : A location defined by \\nmanagerial or political reasons such as \\ndistrict, city, village, town, province, \\ncountry, kingdom, and continent.  \\nNatural : A geographical location \\npointing to either natural landscapes such as \\nriver, canal, and field, or artificial landscape \\nsuch as road, lane, artificial canal, bridge, \\nand buildings.  \\nRelative : A location referred rela -\\ntively using a prepositional marker such as \\n\"in a car,\" \"on the table,\" and \"opposite of \\nthe building\".  \\nLike English, a location expression \\nin Thai language may be led by a \\npreposition or a marker. Moreover, a series \\nof location expressions may represent a \\ncertain location with increasing details.  \\n2.3 Person Name Expression  \\nA person name is a type of proper \\nname that specifies a person. While a first \\nname may precede a last name in some languages, it may be reversed in other \\nlanguages. Like English, a person name \\nmay be led by a title, followed by last name \\nand first name. Besides this, a foreigner‟s \\nname can be represented in Thai by its \\nspelling [30]. In several cases, a person \\nname in Thai can be recognized by applying \\na set of patterns on a running Thai te xt. In \\nthis work, the following pattern is usually \\nfound in a news document and can be used \\nto recognize a person name. In the pattern, \\n(…) means optional, […] specifies manda -\\ntory, and | indicates exclusive disjunction.  \\n \\n(TITLE)[(FN)(MN)(LN) | (NN)]  \\n \\nHere , (TITLE) is a title of a person. \\nIn terms of computation, the title acts as a \\nclue word for detecting a person name. FN, \\nMN and LN denote a string presenting a \\nfirst name, a middle name, and a last name, \\nrespectively. NN stands for a nickname. \\nFor example , “ น ายจ อห์น ” (Mr. John) can be \\nanalyzed as “(TITLE: น าย)(FN: จ อห์น)”, “ ดร. ซู\\nซ าน แ ค ร ก เ ก อร ์ ” (Dr. Susan Cracker) as \\n“(TITLE: ดร.)(FN: ซ ูซ าน)(LN: แ ค ร ก เ ก อร ์ )”, “ น าย\\nน ิค” (Mr. Nick) as “(TITLE: น าย)(NN: น ิค)”. \\n \\nTable 1 Type of verbs in Thai  \\n           Types           Examples  \\nIntransitive \\nverb  น้อ งนอน  \\n(My brother sleeps .) \\nTransitive verb  ฉันกิน ข้าว \\n(I eat rice.)  \\nTo-Be verb  เขาเป็น นัก เรีย น  \\n(He is a student.)  \\nAuxiliary verb  นา ยด  าจะ ไ ปโร ง เรีย น  \\n(Dum will go to school.)  \\nInfinitive verb  ฉันช อ บไ ปเที่ยว ก ับเธอ  \\n(I like to travel  with you.)  \\n \\n3.

       " Document(page_content='Thammasat Int. J. Sc. Tech., Vol. 15 ,  No. 1, January -March 2010  \\n 73 event extraction from a news document. \\nAlthough a n action expression is not \\ncounted as a type of NE, it is worth \\nextracting it from a document, especially \\nnews documents, in order to obtain \\ninformation related to an event. Table 1 \\ndisplays the five common types of Thai \\nverbs; i.e. transitive, intransitiv e, to -be, \\nauxiliary, and infinitive verbs.  \\nHowever, due to the fact that Thai \\nlanguage has no word boundary, detecting a \\nverb, a series of verbs or a verb phrase from \\na news document may not be straight -\\nforward. Especially, a string whose spelling \\nis equiv alent to a short verbal word in a \\ndictionary may not be such a verbal word \\nbut just a part of a longer string which \\nindicates another word. From this point of \\nview, it seems better to focus on only a \\nlonger a verb phrase. Then one potential \\nconstraint is t o handle a verb phrase that is \\nlonger than two syllables . For example, \\nก ระว ีก ระว า ด (grà-wêek-rá-wâat: to hurry; four \\nsyllables) and ล ะล า นตา  (lá laan dtaa: be \\ndazzled; three syllables) . \\nWe know each characteristic of \\neach NE because of its pattern, but another \\nproblem is boundary correction. Shorter or \\nlonger boundary det ection can be found in \\nNE extraction. In order to solve this \\nproblem, we add a set of clue phrases \\nbetween NE tagging sequences. These clue \\nphrases are useful to reduce ambiguity of \\nNE boundary, and then increase the \\naccuracy of NE extraction, especially f or \\nlocation and person. From Table 3, we add \\nperson‟s position between time and location \\ntagging sequence, question, conjunction, \\nadverb and verb phrases with three or more \\nsyllables between location and person \\ntagging sequence. Question phrases with \\nthree  or more syllables such as เพร า ะเ หตุใ ด  \\n(prór hèt dai: why; three syllables). \\nConjunction with three or more syllables \\nsuch as เช ่นเดียว ก ับ (chên dieow gàp: as well \\nas; three syllables). A dverb phrases with \\nthree or more syllables such as ช ั่ว ล ูก ช ั่ว หล า น (chûa lôok chûa lăan: forever; four \\nsyllables).  \\n \\n4. Pattern -based Extraction  \\n \\nSince we would like to extract NE \\nsuch as person, date, time, location, and \\naction phrases in Thai news documents, we \\nassume that the combination of various \\nexisting soluti ons involved with this task \\ncan be another way to achieve both \\ndetection and extraction. Nowadays, \\ninformation is available in various kinds of \\nformat, lists of words, and dictionaries \\nwhich are great tools that can be used to \\nprocess natural language.

TIF is composed of \\ncharacter, number, space, symbol, and \\nmarks ordered by its longest matching \\ncombination. We will consider TCCs \\nalgorithm in every connection between \\n(TXT)(PT T) and (PTT)(TXT). The \\ncombinations of boundaries and types are \\n16 patterns:  \\n \\n(SPC|TXT)(CW| ∅)(TIF)(CW| ∅)(S\\nPC|TXT)  \\nFor each NE type, level of \\nambiguity is different. NE type with (CW)(TIF)(CW) is less ambiguity than \\n(∅)(TIF)(∅). The position of clue word in \\neach NE type can be classified as shown in \\nTable 2. In Table 2, we can conclude that \\nperso n and action phrases have the most \\nambiguity found, because of no clue word \\nfor detection. When we consider a semantic \\nlevel, date and time have less ambiguity \\nthan person and action, so we can construct \\ntagging sequence starting with date and \\ntime and so on, as in Table 3.  \\nAlgorithm 1 shows how NEs can be \\nextracted using our pattern -based method. \\nGiven a set of news documents D and a set \\nof patterns P, the algorithm will output a set \\nof NEs E grouped by their types.

Experiment  \\n \\nOur domain for NE extraction is \\nThai news documents, collected from \\nwebsites in these categories: crime, \\neconomic, foreign , politic and sport. News \\ndocuments in each category are taken from \\nThai three news publishers: KomChad -\\nLuek1, DailyNews2, and Manager3. There \\nare several data owners contributing their \\ndata in digital format and publishing online. \\nWe easily collect the li sts of word and \\nvarious kinds of dictionaries as shown in \\nTable 4. Words in the list of word and \\ndictionaries are ordered by maximum \\n                                                 \\n1 KomChadLuek: http://www.komchadluek.net  \\n2 DailyNews: http://www.dailynews.co.th  \\n3 Manager: http://www.manager.co.th  longest word. After we combine the number \\nof words from lists and dictionaries with \\npattern -based extraction, we have possi ble \\npatterns for each NE as in Table 5.  \\n \\nTable 2 The position of clue word in each \\nNE type. „Pre‟ and „Suf‟mean prefix and \\nsuffix, respectively.  \\n(Pre,Suf)  DAT  TIM  LOC  PER  ACT  \\n(+;+)  Y Y Y N N \\n(+;−)  Y Y Y Y Y \\n(−;+)  Y Y Y N N \\n(−;−)  Y Y Y Y Y \\n \\n5.1 Implementation and Results   \\nAfter we applied pattern -based \\nextraction with all words in word lists and \\ndictionaries to all Thai news documents, the \\nresults are shown in Table 6. The number of \\ncorrect results for date, time, conjunction \\nphrase with three or more syllables, and \\nadverb phrase with three or more syllables \\nare very high, but the number of correct \\nresults for persons is low. We know that the \\nidentification of a person‟s surname and a \\nperson‟ s name without surname are very \\nhard to find the exact boundary. The \\nnumber of correct results in each news \\ncategory is shown in Table 7. From the \\nresult, the identification of date and time are \\nhighly significant in every news category. \\nAmong all categori es, we gain the highest \\naccuracy for the „crime‟ category. The \\nperformance order in detecting NE is crime, \\neconomics, politics, foreign and sports, \\nrespectively. When we investigated Thai \\nsports news documents, we found that the \\nwritten style for news in t his category is \\nquite different from our provided patterns, \\nand a lot of complex sentences have been \\nfound. On the other hand, in the crime \\ncategory, written structure and sentences are \\ncloser to our pattern -based extraction, \\nwhich is Thai common usage, so  the \\nnumber of possible NEs are numerously \\ndetected in this category.

A verb may be a part of project‟s \\nname and it should not be extracted, for \\nexample โครง ก า รรับประกันคุณภาพ สินค้าแล ะบริก า ร  \\n(The Quality Assurance  Project of Products \\nand Services), and รัฐมนตร ีช่วยว่าการ  (Vice \\nMinister). A person title abbreviation is \\nincorrectly recognized such as นสพ . เซา เทิร์น  เม\\nโทร โปล ิส  (Southern Metropolis Newsletter, \\nนสพ . stands for N ewsletter but สพ . stands for \\nVeterinarian). A person name without a \\nsurname such as เอกช ัย  อยู่ที่โรงพยาบาล  (Ekachai \\nYooTeeRongPayaban , YooTeeRongPaya -\\nban is an action phrase which means „to \\nstay in a hospital‟, but it is recognized as \\nEkachai‟s surname). Some pronouns may \\nbe recognized as person title such as ใ ห้คุณ ฟ รี \\n(“to give you for free” is recognized as “to \\ngive to Mr. Free”). A person title may be recognized as a part of a verb such as ขอบคุณ\\nประช า ช น  (Thank you citizen). Other errors are \\ntriggered by  word boundary ambiguity, \\ninappropriateness of patterns and misspelled \\nwords.  \\n \\nTable 4 List of dictionaries and word lists  \\nNE Type \\n&Phrase  Information \\nType  No. of \\nRecords  \\nPER Title  555 \\nPER Title Abbreviation  340 \\nPER Title Excepti on 198 \\nPER Position  244 \\nLOC  Amphoe  924 \\nLOC  Province  76 \\nLOC  Thai government \\ndepartment  2449  \\nLOC  Thai government \\norganization  309 \\nLOC  Common country name  192 \\nLOC  Full country name  192 \\nLOC  Capital city name  194 \\nDAT -TIM Time unit  26 \\nDAT -TIM Season  17 \\nDAT -TIM Number  30 \\nDAT -TIM Month  24 \\nDAT -TIM Era 16 \\nDAT -TIM Day 14 \\nDAT -TIM Year  24 \\nPREP  Preposition for location  63 \\nACT  Verb phrase with three or \\nmore syllables  2767  \\nACT  Verb  13027  \\nQUE  Question phrase with \\nthree or more syllables  6 \\nCONJ  Conjunctio n phrase with \\nthree or more syllables  88 \\nADV  Adverb phrase with three \\nor more syllables  912 \\n \\n6.

The term is similar in concept to mobile-first, which refers to designing applications for mobile devices before desktop or other platforms. Voice-First can have an additional, adjunct interface (usually a visual one) that supplements the user experience. For example, a user can ask a Voice-First system if the nearest post office is open, receive the answer verbally, and then be provided with additional details about the post office location on a visual interface. The goal of a Voice-First approach is to create a user experience that is primarily based on voice interactions, rather than relying on traditional interfaces such as text or touch. This approach can be particularly useful in situations where users have their hands occupied, such as while driving or cooking, or for individuals with limited mobility or vision. Voice-First interfaces can be implemented using various technologies, such as voice assistants, chatbots, or speech recognition systems. These systems can be integrated into a wide range of devices, including smartphones, smart speakers, and other smart home devices.\\n      omniscien.com/blog/speech-recognition-speech-synthesis-glossary-v-z/index.html\\\\nomniscien.com/category/faq/index.html\\\\nomniscien.com/blog/localization-glossary-terminology-that-you-should-know/index.html\\n      47 sec\\n    \\n    \\n      2023-09-21 07:48:17\\n      2.0\\n      fastchat-t5-3b-v1.0\\n      No quantization\\n      hello\\n      \\n      <pad> Hello!

       " Document(page_content='Voice First refers to interfaces or applications where the primary interface between the user and the system is based on voice. The term is similar in concept to mobile-first, which refers to designing applications for mobile devices before desktop or other platforms. Voice-First can have an additional, adjunct interface (usually a visual one) that supplements the user experience. For example, a user can ask a Voice-First system if the nearest post office is open, receive the answer verbally, and then be provided with additional details about the post office location on a visual interface. The goal of a Voice-First approach is to create a user experience that is primarily based on voice interactions, rather than relying on traditional interfaces such as text or touch. This approach can be particularly useful in situations where users have their hands occupied, such as while driving or cooking, or for individuals with limited mobility or vision. Voice-First interfaces can be implemented using various technologies, such as voice assistants, chatbots, or speech recognition systems. These systems can be integrated into a wide range of devices, including smartphones, smart speakers, and other smart home devices.', metadata={'Timestamp': '2023-09-21 07:47:15', 'Demo Version': 2.0, 'Model': 'Llama-2-7b-chat-hf', 'Quantization': 'llamaCpp', 'Question': 'what is first question?', 'Context': nan, 'URL': 'omniscien.com/blog/speech-recognition-speech-synthesis-glossary-v-z/index.html\\nomniscien.com/category/faq/index.html\\nomniscien.com/blog/localization-glossary-terminology-that-you-should-know/index.html', 'Response Time': '47 sec', 'source': 'upload_data_type/excel/docqa_v-2.0_logs_2023-09-21.xlsx'}),\n",
