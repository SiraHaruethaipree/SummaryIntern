With sufficient in-domain data\\xa0Neural MT is able to “think” more like the human brain when producing translations. Unlike SMT, this can be in excess of 50 million bilingual sentences as just the starting point. Omniscien provides much of this data, and mines and synthesizes millions of new bilingual sentences for each engine.\\n\\nBehind many of the tools design is Omniscien’s Chief Scientist, Professor Philipp Koehn who leads our team of researchers and developers. Philipp is a pioneer in the machine translation space. His books on Statistical Machine Translation and Neural Machine Translation are the leading academic textbooks globally on machine translation. Both books are available now from Amazon.com or leading book stores.', metadata={'source': 'omniscien.com/faq/what-is-neural-machine-translation/index.html'})]"
