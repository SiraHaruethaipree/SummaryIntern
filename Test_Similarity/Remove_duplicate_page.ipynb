Did you know that you can more than double your productivity with machine translation when it is optimized for purpose? üëçüëçüëç\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence Built for   Smart Language Processing\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence Built for   Smart Language Processing\\n\\nData is the Fuel    that Powers Artificial Intelligence\\n\\nData is the Fuel    thatPowers Artificial Intelligence\\n\\nBuilt on the world‚Äôs leading translation, language processing, workflow automation, and artificial intelligence technologies.\\n\\nTranslation and language processing technologies have evolved substantially over the last decade. The Omniscien team has been at the forefront of research and development, leading the way with a comprehensive set of integrated tools, features, and technologies that are powered by and drive artificial intelligence and machine learning.\\n\\nNaturally, Omniscien tools and technologies are heavily reliant on high-quality specialized data to power our platform and technologies. Because we understand the importance of high-quality data, the Omniscien team is dedicated to breaking new ground with novel research and approaches to creating, mining, harvesting, synthesizing, and manufacturing data. Omniscien has built a variety of powerful tools for data creation, preparation, and analysis.\\n\\nBehind many of the tools design is Omniscien‚Äôs Chief Scientist, Professor Philipp Koehn who leads our team of researchers and developers. Philipp is a pioneer in the machine translation space, his books on Statistical Machine Translation and Neural Machine Translation are the leading academic textbooks globally on machine translation. Both books are available now from Amazon.com or leading book stores.\\n\\nProfessor Philipp Koehn,Chief Scientist,Omniscien Technologies.\\n\\nState-of-the-Art   Machine Translation\\n\\nSecure Cloud, On-Premises, and Data Center scalability.\\n\\nAt the heart of all of Omniscien‚Äôs tools and products is state-of-the-art machine translation technology. Developed and refined for over 14 years, the Omniscien team has continually strived to innovate and deliver the highest quality translation output and most flexible machine translation platform.\\n\\nLanguage Studio provides specialized machine translation engines for use in Media Studio and Workflow Studio that are optimized for a specific purpose such as subtitle translation. The complexity and power of these purpose-optimized workflows and machine translation engines are hidden away with easy use tools and user interfaces.\\n\\nPerforming a translation is simple and easy. However, when you want to take control, Language Studio provides workflow scripting and many more features that place you in the driving seat.\\n\\nNo matter your performance and scalability need Language Studio has a platform edition to match. Language Studio provides a wide range of machine translation options and features to cover even the most complex of business use cases.\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nCustom    Machine Translation Engines\\n\\nCustomize to your own writing style, vocabulary, and context.\\n\\nGeneric translation systems such as Google are designed to deliver a gist or general meaning for anything, anytime, and anyone so that text can be understood.\\n\\nBeing able to understand is just not good enough at Omniscien!!\\n\\nOur goal is quite different with a much higher quality bar. Omniscien customized machine translation engines are designed to deliver a translation output that requires the least amount of human effort in order to publish. When translation quality directly impacts the bottom line and accuracy is important, a custom MT engine will always deliver the highest quality translation output.\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nSpecialized   Industry Domains\\n\\nQuality is delivered by a better understanding of context.\\n\\nUnlike a human, machines cannot understand context (yet). The simple phrase ‚ÄúI caught a virus‚Äù could refer to your personal health or to your computer. Context can change the meaning to something totally different. Industry domains provide the context needed for higher quality translations.\\n\\nBy training MT engines with the high-quality bilingual data that contains the correct context, the context of the resulting translations is conveyed and the quality of the translation is notably better.\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nSpecialized Workflows Driven by  Artificial Intelligence   and Natural Language Processing\\n\\nDifferent business requirements can only be optimized by specialized workflows and adaptation of tools and processes.\\n\\nOmniscien products, such as Media Studio and Language Studio, are optimized and built for purpose. The tools that we use are available and can be readily adapted to meet many different business needs. Our expansive library of language processing tools, workflow automation technologies and artificial intelligence solutions provide a unique platform from which to build specialized solutions.\\n\\nThe Omniscien team will work with you to build workflows for language processing, voice recognition, optical character recognition (OCR), data mining, data analysis, and data automation or you can leverage our technologies to build your own solutions.\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nSee how Omniscien can helpsolve your unique language and document processing challenges\\n\\nRequest a Demo\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nSubscribe to our Mailing List\\n\\nProducts\\n\\nLanguage Studio\\n\\nMedia Studio\\n\\nServices\\n\\nCustom MT Engines\\n\\nCustom Workflows\\n\\nConsulting\\n\\nMachine Translation\\n\\nMachine Translation Overview\\n\\nDetailed Features\\n\\nIndustry Domain MT Engines\\n\\nCustom MT Engines\\n\\nData Creation Tools\\n\\nWays to Translate\\n\\nHybrid NMT/SMT Engines\\n\\nHuman Language Technology (HLT)\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence & Machine Learning\\n\\nState-of-the-Art Machine Translation\\n\\nNeural Machine Translation (NMT)\\n\\nStatistical Machine Translation (SMT)\\n\\nHybrid Deep NMT/SMT\\n\\nMachine Translation Engine Training\\n\\nData Synthesis, and Data Creation\\n\\nData Cleaning\\n\\nMeasurement\\n\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\\n\\nWorkflow Automation\\n\\nSubtitle, Video, Audio, and Media\\n\\nData Source and Integration\\n\\nData Conversion\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSupport\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nWebinars\\n\\nIntegrated Solution Partners\\n\\nTechnology Partners\\n\\nSupported Languages\\n\\nSupported Document Formats\\n\\nData Security and Privacy\\n\\nDeployment Models\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nInternships\\n\\nNews\\n\\nOffice Locations\\n\\nLegal\\n\\nConnect\\n\\nFollow\\n\\nFollow\\n\\nFollow\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nRequest a Demo\\n\\nSubscribe to Mailing List\\n\\nCopyright ¬© 2023 Omniscien Technologies.
