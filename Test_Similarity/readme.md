This folder contain python script file which experiment as following:
- Test similarity method e.g. Top-k, MMR
- Test embedding model, which embedding model respone goo result. we ref from MTEB(https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)

Note: Currently, We use similarity score threshold method and select k=5 documents and embedding model we use thenlper/gte-base is perform well then other model.
