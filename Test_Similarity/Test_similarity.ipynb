       " Document(page_content='Search\\n\\nRiding the Machine Translation Hype Cycle – From SMT to NMT to Deep NMT by Dion Wiggins\\n\\nThere is a running joke in the translation industry that machine translation will be a solved problem in 5 years. This has been updated every 5 years since the 1950’s. The promise was always there, but the technology of the day simply could not deliver.\\n\\nHowever, there has undoubtedly been progress. When we started our company over 10 years ago, MT was considered a joke and ridiculed. At the time, we looked to purchase MT technology, but were unable to find any technology that could rise to the challenges that we needed to address. At the time we had the formidable task of translating all of Wikipedia and other high volume and very mixed content domains from English into mostly second or third-tier Asian languages.\\n\\nTo find a way to address that problem, we flew in Philipp Koehn to introduce him to our concepts and ideas. Philipp at the time was a promising researcher in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and recently created a large corpus of bilingual content derived from European Parliament documents and had just released the first version of the Moses SMT decoder which in the meantime has become the de-facto platform for SMT. Soon after, Philipp joined our team as Chief Scientist and has been driving research and development efforts ever since. Philipp joining the team gave us the in-depth knowledge of MT that few had at the time and allowed us to stay ahead of the competition from a technical perspective. While Philipp was the father of the Moses decoder, his Master’s thesis in the 1990’s was on Neural Networks before they become practical for machine translation.', metadata={'source': 'omniscien.com/blog/riding-machine-translation-hype-cycle/index.html'}),\n",

The Moses decoder has progressively matured and is the de facto benchmark for research in the field. However, Moses was not intended to be a commercial machine translation offering. There are considerable amounts of additional functionality, beyond providing a web based user interface for Moses, that are not included in Moses that are essential in order to offer a strong and innovative commercial machine translation platform.\\n\\nWhen conceiving the idea of Moses, the primary goal was to foster research and advance the state of MT in academia by providing a de facto base from which to innovate from.\\xa0Currently the vast majority of interesting MT research and advancements still takes place in academia. Without open source toolkits such as Moses, all the exciting work would be done by the Google’s and Microsoft’s of the world, as is the case in related fields such as information retrieval or automatic speech recognition.\\n\\nAs a platform for academic research, Moses provides a strong foundation.

Translations that follow all grammatical conventions, adhere to rules for line breaks, punctuation, alignment and capitalization are easier to read – resulting in improved understanding of an original message. This is the basic fundamentals of high-quality translation. However, every use case has different requirements and there are tradeoffs between translation quality, speed of translation, time and effort to translate, amount of human review and post-editing, and the cost or budget for the tasks.\\n\\nIn many cases, a high quality translation should also be specifically adapted for a target audience, writing style, industry domain and purpose. A body of text may be translated perfectly, but totally unsuitable for the target audience.

This has been updated every 5 years since the 1950’s. The promise was always there, but the technology of the day simply could not deliver.\\n\\nHowever, there has undoubtedly been progress. When we started our company over 10 years ago, MT was considered a joke and ridiculed. At the time, we looked to purchase MT technology, but were unable to find any technology that could rise to the challenges that we needed to address. At the time we had the formidable task of translating all of Wikipedia and other high volume and very mixed content domains from English into mostly second or third-tier Asian languages.\\n\\nTo find a way to address that problem, we flew in Philipp Koehn to introduce him to our concepts and ideas. Philipp at the time was a promising researcher in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and recently created a large corpus of bilingual content derived from European Parliament documents and had just released the first version of the Moses SMT decoder which in the meantime has become the de-facto platform for SMT. Soon after, Philipp joined our team as Chief Scientist and has been driving research and development efforts ever since. Philipp joining the team gave us the in-depth knowledge of MT that few had at the time and allowed us to stay ahead of the competition from a technical perspective. While Philipp was the father of the Moses decoder, his Master’s thesis in the 1990’s was on Neural Networks before they become practical for machine translation.', metadata={'source': 'omniscien.com/blog/riding-machine-translation-hype-cycle/index.html'}),\n",
